# raycasting

Raycasting has always been an interesting concept for me. After taking the last few weeks to understand the math and concepts behind its use, I will be attempting to create a raycasting program and eventually a game of my own. As an example, the id software title "Wolfenstein" uses raycasting to render their 2d models and maps to appear 3d. 

This raycaster is currently in python. It will be available in "Releases" as a zip file. Simply unzip the folder anywhere. As long as all the files in the unzipped folder are in the same location, the project should work. Simply double click the executable to start the simulation. 

To turn left and right, press the left and right arrow keys. To move forward and backward press the up and down arrow keys.

*WARNING*

When the program starts, don't try to click the 'X' in the top right to close it. It's very unoptimized and trying to close it this way will cause Python to freeze. Simply press the "Esc" or "Escape" key to stop the simulation.

ENJOY!!!
