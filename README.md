# raycasting

Raycasting has always been an interesting concept for me. After taking the last few weeks to understand the math and concepts behind its use, I will be attempting to create a raycasting program and eventually a game of my own. As an example, the id software title "Wolfenstein" uses raycasting to render their 2d models and maps to appear 3d. 

This raycaster is currently in python. It will be available in "Releases" as an executable. Download the executable and run it to try it out!!

To turn left and right and move forward and backwards, you can use the arrow keys or the traditional wasd movement keys. 

*WARNING*

When the program starts, don't try to click the 'X' in the top right to close it. It's very unoptimized and trying to close it this way will cause Python to freeze. Simply press the "Esc" or "Escape" key to stop the simulation.

ENJOY!!!
