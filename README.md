# raycasting

Raycasting has always been an interesting concept for me. After taking the last few weeks to understand the math and concepts behind its use, I will be attempting to create a raycasting program and eventually a game of my own. As an example, the id software title "Wolfenstein" uses raycasting to render their 2d models and maps to appear 3d. 

This repository will be mainly in Python.
